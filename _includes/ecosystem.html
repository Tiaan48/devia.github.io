          All popular cryptocurrencies like "Bitcoin" have a static economy  with fixed total money supply.
          UnA has a unique dynamic economy with variable total money supply linked to annual GDP of Africa.
          
- UNA is main trading currency unit

        2,251,280,000,000 USD = 2,251,280,000,000AFRI = 22,512,800 UNA
          
- Initial total money supply: 22 512 800 UNA
